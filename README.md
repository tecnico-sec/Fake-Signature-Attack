## Goals
The goal of this repository is to learn how to execute a collision attack on hash algorithm sha-1. You will learn how to use an Open-Source Python function on your local machine and also analyse the function step-by-step. We will use the function of the following public repository: 
https://github.com/nneonneo/sha1collider.

## Introduction
The Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1) was released in 1995 by NIST, and since then it has been used to check the integrity of data. This hash function, SHA-1 takes an arbitrary size input and generate a fixed-size value of 160 bits. As every hash function, SHA-1 have some common properties, it must generate very different output values for similar inputs, 
the function is an one-way function, which means that given an output, it must be impossible to get the respective input, and the function has to be resistant to collisions, it must be computationally infeasible to find two inputs that give the same output. 
Since 2005, due to cryptanalysis, different attack reports on SHA-1 have been released by different entities, announcing improvements to different kind of attacks to this algortithm, like brute-force attacks.
In 2017, the CWI (Centrum Wiskund & Informatica) and Google annouced an attack where they generated two different PDF files with the same SHA-1 hash, which is the attack we are studying here.
The attack performed was an identical-prefix collision attack, where a given prefix P is extended with two distinct near-collision block pairs such that they collide for any suffix S:

You can find the prefix and the two near-collision block pairs and how were they chosen and calculated in this article: https://shattered.io/static/shattered.pdf

This attacks benefits from the structure of the jpeg images in pdf files. 


## Setup
Before starting this assignment you will need a few steps to be able to execute the attack:

- At first you will need to install python:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install python3
```

- Then you will need to clone this repository into your workspace

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tecnico-sec/Fake-Signature-Attack.git
```
or via SSH

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:tecnico-sec/Fake-Signature-Attack.git
```

- You need to install the library Pillow.

```bash
$ pip install Pillow
```

- You need to install ghostscript:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get -y install ghostscript
```

- You need to install cjpeg:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get -y install cjpeg:
```

You are now able to execute the attack:
Calculate the Sha1 hash code for the both files in the directory:
 ```bash
$ sha1sum eve.pdf
$ sha1sum eve1B.pdf
```

Compare the two hashes.

Execute the following command:
```bash
$ python3 collide.py eve.pdf eve1B.pdf
``` 

Note that two new pdfs were generated, out-eve.pdf and out-eve1B.pdf.
If some output file is corrupted try the following command:
```bash
$ python3 collide.py eve.pdf eve1B.pdf --progressive
``` 

Calculate the Sha1 hash code for both output files.

```bash
$ sha1sum out-eve.pdf
$ sha1sum out-eve1B.pdf
```

Compare the two hashes.
